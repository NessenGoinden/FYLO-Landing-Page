## Welcome! 👋 🙎🏽‍♂️

Thanks for checking out this front-end coding challenge.

[Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io) challenges helped me improve my skills in a real-life workflow.

## The challenge ⏳

The challenge is to build out a FYLO landing page and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

I can use any tools I like to help me complete the challenge.

The users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size

** For this challenge I started with mobile first **

**Had great fun coding this pricing table 🚀 **
